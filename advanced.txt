Error Handling:
Add error handling to manage cases where the movie is not found or the API call fails.

User Interface:
You could create a more user-friendly interface, possibly a web interface using Flask or a desktop application using Tkinter.

Caching Results:
Implement caching to store results of recent searches to reduce the number of API calls.

Error Handling: Currently, you're only checking if the movie is not found. It might be helpful to handle other potential errors, such as network issues or API rate limiting.

Input Validation: You might want to add some input validation to ensure that the user input is valid (e.g., not empty) before making the API call.

API Key Security: Storing your API key in a separate configuration file is a good practice, but you could also consider using environment variables or a secure key management service for added security.

Modularization: Depending on the complexity of your project, you might want to modularize your code further. For example, you could have separate modules for API interaction, input/output handling, and error handling.

Documentation: Adding comments and docstrings to your code can make it more readable and maintainable, especially if others will be working on it.

Testing: Consider writing tests for your code, especially for edge cases and error handling, to ensure that it behaves as expected.

Logging: Incorporating logging functionality can help you debug issues and track the execution flow of your script.

User Experience: Enhance the user experience by providing more informative messages and handling edge cases gracefully.
